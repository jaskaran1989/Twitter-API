Before you start, you need three things:

I am here using The most popular PHP library for use with the Twitter OAuth REST API. https://twitteroauth.com

Basically what this app does is it fetches the information of users like there tweets, followers,friend, profile pic and many more. This app is in very simple mode for now will be be advanced in future right also have limited css styling which will advanced soon.
