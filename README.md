# Twitter-API
This project is just for educational purposes to explore Twitter API and how to use them.

Technologies Used
* PHP
* Twitter API
* HTML
* CSS


Before you start, you need three things:

* A developer account on Twitter. (dev.twitter.com)
* A Twitter app for the API keys and access tokens (apps.twitter.com)
* The Twitter OAuth PHP class (twitteroauth.com)

I am here using The most popular PHP library for use with the Twitter OAuth REST API. https://twitteroauth.com

Basically what this app does is it fetches the infmation of users like there tweet, followers, profile pic and many more. This app wll be be advanced in future right now this has limited css styling which should follow soon to next level.
